# Monitoring, Troubleshooting and Tracing

## Introduction

Occasionally things doesn't go as planned. When that happens, you can rely on instrumentation in Data Pump that will provide you better understanding of what's going on. In this lab, you will learn ways of monitoring Data Pump and dig deeper into the details with tracing.

Estimated Time: 20 Minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Monitor, troubleshoot and trace

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes:

- You have completed Lab 7: Checksum and Encryption

## Task 1: Monitoring

In lab 5, your learned about the interactive console and the `STATUS` command. You also used a few views in the database. In Oracle Database 23ai, there are new views with even better details on your Data Pump jobs. 

1. Use the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. Copy an existing dump file to the *DPDIR* directory.

    ```
    <copy>
    cp /home/oracle/scripts/faster-import-constraints.dmp /home/oracle/dpdir/monitoring.dmp
    </copy>
    ```

2. Examine a pre-created parameter file.

    ```
    <copy>
    cat /home/oracle/scripts/dp-09-monitor-import.par
    </copy>
    ```

    * This is a regular import.
    * Notice the `JOB_NAME` parameter. This gives the Data Pump a specific name, so you can easily attach to the Data Pump from a different session. The import will run for a while and you will attach to the job and monitor it.

    ``` text
    directory=dpdir
    dumpfile=monitoring.dmp
    parallel=4
    logfile=dp-09-monitor-import.log
    logtime=all
    metrics=yes
    job_name=MONITORING
    ```
    </details> 

3. Start the import.

    ```
    <copy>
    . cdb23
    impdp dpuser/oracle@localhost/red parfile=/home/oracle/scripts/dp-09-monitor-import.par
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * Don't wait for the import to complete.
    * Leave it running in the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨.
    * Move on with the next step.

4. Now, switch to the *blue* ðŸŸ¦ terminal. Connect to the same database.

    ```
    <copy>
    . cdb23
    sqlplus / as sysdba
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

4. Switch into the *RED* PDB and query one of the new views.

    ```
    <copy>
    alter session set container=red;
    set line 150
    col program format a60
    select program, sessionid, status 
    from   v$datapump_process_info 
    where  jobname='MONITORING';
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * There are five Data Pump processes.
    * The control process (formerly known as *master process*) is seen as *DM00*.
    * The four workers are seen as *DW0n*.

5. What are the current waits?

    ```
    <copy>
    col event format a40
    select waiting_session, event, dp_state_in_wait 
    from v$datapump_sessionwait_info;
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * One process is busy during *direct path sync*. Perhaps this database doesn't use direct I/O (`FILESYSTEMIO_OPTIONS=SETALL`). 
    * The other processes are waiting for *log buffer space*. Perhaps you could tune the system by putting redo logs on faster disks, implement more redo log groups or larger redo log members, or even import with `NOLOGGING` clause. You could implement the latter with `TRANSFORM=DISABLE_ARCHIVE_LOGGING:Y`.
    * There are additional columns in the view that can supply additional information about the wait event, like which objects it involves.

6. Check the details on the last of the new views.

    ```
    <copy>
    desc v$datapump_processwait_info

    CON_ID                                             NUMBER
    ```
    </details> 

7. Exit SQL*Plus.

    ```
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

8. Switch back to the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. If the job is still running, you can stop it. While you watch the Data Pump log output, hit `CTRL+C`. This takes you from the log output to the interactive console.

    ```
    CTRL+C
    ```

    * In lab 5, *Faster Imports*, you learned how to use the interactive console.

9. Now, kill the job.

    ```
    <copy>
    kill_job
    </copy>
    ```

    * Confirm by inputting `YES``
    * It takes a little while for Data Pump to stop the job. 
    * If you thing it's too slow, press `CTRL+C` again.

10. Drop the schema that were imported.


    ```
    <copy>
    . cdb23
    sqlplus / as sysdba<<EOF
       alter session set container=red;
       drop user constr_validate cascade;

## Task 2: Control table and abort_step

The control table contains information about the data and metadata in the dump file. Plus, Data Pump uses it to keep track of the job.

1. Still in the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. Start the import from task 1 again. However, this time you import just the control table from the dump file.

    ```
    <copy>
    . cdb23
    impdp dpuser/oracle@localhost/red parfile=/home/oracle/scripts/dp-09-monitor-import.par master_only=yes
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * You use the parameter `MASTER_ONLY` to inform Data Pump to import just the control file.
    * Data Pump writes the name of the control file in the output.

4. Make a list of the object paths planned to be executed by Data Pump. 

    ```
    <copy>
    set line 150
    set pagesize 200
    col object_name format a30
    col object_type format a30
    select object_name, object_type, process_order 
    from dpuser.monitoring 
    where process_order > 0
    order by process_order;
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * By ordering on `PROCESS_ORDER` you can get an idea on the order how Data Pump does things.
    * First, getting the schema in, then tables, then rows and finally the constraints.
    * Notice how `TABLE_DATA` starts at `PROCESS_ORDER=10`.

5. Drop the control table.

    <copy>
    drop table dpuser.monitoring purge;
    </copy>
    ```

    Table dropped.
    ```
    </details> 

6. Exit SQL*Plus.

    ```
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

7. Start the import again, but stop at step 10. This is right before loading rows in the `TABLE_DATA` phase. You found this in the query on the control table using the `PROCESS_ORDER` column.

    ```
    <copy>
    . cdb23
    impdp dpuser/oracle@localhost/red parfile=/home/oracle/scripts/dp-09-monitor-import.par abort_step=10
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * The `ABORT_STEP` parameter tells Data Pump to stop the job right before starting this phase.
    * If you want to stop the job right after loading the control table, you can use `ABORT_STEP=-1`.

9. Use the interactive console to restart the job.    

    ```
    <copy>
    start_job
    </copy>
    ```

10. Wait a few seconds and get the latest status.
    
    ```
    <copy>
    status
    </copy>
    ```

    * Notice the state is now *EXECUTING*.
    * The workers should be busy loading rows. 
    * Run the `STATUS` command a few times and see how *Completed rows* increases.

11. Switch from the interactive console to the Data Pump log output.

    ```
    <copy>
    continue_client
    </copy>
    ```

    * If you wait a while, Data Pump will start to write log messages to the console.
    * Loading the rows takes a while and Data Pump doesn't write anything until all the rows are loaded.
    * If you're patient and would like to see the next log line, wait a few minutes. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

12. Switch from the log output back to the interactive console by hitting `CTRL+C`. 

    ```
    CTRL+C
    ```

    * Hit `CTRL+C` only once. Otherwise, you will forcefully exit the Data Pump client.
    * It's safe to hit `CTRL+C`. Remember, Data Pump runs server side, so even if you kill the client, you can just attach to the job again.

13. Kill the job from the interactive console.

    ```
    <copy>
    kill_job
    </copy>
    ```

    * Confirm that you want to kill the job.

14. Drop the schema that were imported.

    ```
    <copy>
    . cdb23
    sqlplus / as sysdba<<EOF
       alter session set container=red;
       drop user constr_validate cascade;
    EOF
