# Faster Imports

## Introduction

If you use Data Pump to migrate entire databases, you often want it to happen as fast as possible. There are several techniques that you can use with Data Pump that will speed up the import process. In this lab, you will use these techniques and see the effect of them.

Estimated Time: 20 Minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Use techniques to import faster

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes:

- You have completed Lab 3: Getting Started

## Task 1: SecureFile LOBs

Oracle Database stores LOBs in two formats. *SecureFile LOBs* is the newest format with a lot of advantages over the older format, *BasicFile LOBs*. Oracle recommends that you store your LOBs in SecureFile format.

1. Use the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. Copy an existing dump file into the *dpdir* directory. The dump contains a schema with a table that contains a BasicFile LOB.

    ```
    <copy>
    cp /home/oracle/scripts/faster-import-lob.dmp /home/oracle/dpdir
    </copy>
    ```

2. Examine a pre-created parameter file.

    ```
    <copy>
    cat /home/oracle/scripts/dp-05-lob-basicfile.par
    </copy>
    ```

    * This is a simple import parameter file with nothing special.

    ``` text
    directory=dpdir
    dumpfile=faster-import-lob.dmp
    logfile=faster-import-lob-basicfile.log
    metrics=yes
    logtime=all
    parallel=4    
    ```
    </details> 

3. Set the environment to *FTEX* and import.
    
    ```
    <copy>
    . ftex
    impdp dpuser/oracle parfile=/home/oracle/scripts/dp-05-lob-basicfile.par
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * The table *BLOBLOAD.TAB1* contains a BasicFile LOB column.
    * Notice how long it took to import the table. In the example in the instructions it took 121 seconds.
    * Also, Data Pump used direct path to load the table.

4. Drop the schema, so you can import again.

    ```
    <copy>
    sqlplus / as sysdba<<EOF
       drop user blobload cascade;
    EOF
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

5. Examine another parameter file.

    ```
    <copy>
    cat /home/oracle/scripts/dp-05-lob-securefile.par
    </copy>
    ```

    * This is similar to the previous parameter file, except for `TRANSFORM=LOB_STORAGE:SECUREFILE`.
    * This transformation instruct Data Pump to create all LOB columns as SecureFile LOBs regardless of the original definition.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    directory=dpdir
    dumpfile=faster-import-lob.dmp
    logfile=faster-import-lob-securefile.log
    metrics=yes
    logtime=all
    parallel=4
    transform=lob_storage:securefile    
    ```
    </details> 

6. Perform another import with the changed parameter file.
    
    ```
    <copy>
    impdp dpuser/oracle parfile=/home/oracle/scripts/dp-05-lob-securefile.par
    </copy>
    ```

    * Data Pump now chooses a different access method, external table. Previously, Data Pump selected direct path. 
    * Loading data into a SecureFile LOB allows Data Pump to choose other load methods and using parallel query (PQ) processes.
    * Compare the time it took to import the table with the previous import. Importing into a SecureFile LOB is faster. In the example in the instructions, it went from 121 seconds to 80 seconds. 
    * Oracle recommends that you always convert BasicFile LOBs to SecureFile LOBs on import. It's faster and SecureFile LOBs offer superior functionality. 
    * It's safe to always add `TRANSFORM=LOB_STORAGE:SECUFILE` to your parameter files. If a LOB is already a SecureFile, Data Pump ignores the transformation.
